## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Power System at [Technical University of Madrid (UPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Madrid), supervised by [Prof. Luis Badesa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8DQgsZQAAAAJ). My current research line is "Power system economics with stability guarantees and resilience enhancement". Before this, I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%87%8D%E5%BA%86%E9%82%AE%E7%94%B5%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6), supervised by [Prof. Yiwei Ma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yiwei-Ma-6).

## Research Interests

- **Power system optimization:** Power market, Optimal operation, Stability guarantee
- **Clustering algorithm:** Fuzzy c-means, Improved clustering algorithms

## News

- **[01. Apr. 2025]** Our paper titled "Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model" for 16th IEEE PowerTech Conference in Kiel has been accepted.
  
- **[10. Feb. 2025]** Welcome You Wu to our lab, studying as an exchange student from [North China Electric Power University](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%8E%E5%8C%97%E7%94%B5%E5%8A%9B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6). Her research topic is "Bilevel model application in the power market problems: Specifically for Stackelberg games". Hope we can have some interesting productions.
  
- **[03. Jan. 2025]** I have an internship in [Tsinghua Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute](https://www.tsinghua-eiri.org/), focusing on the power system.
  
- **[01. Oct. 2024]** I am thrilled to start research about power system as a Ph.D. student in UPM. Hope all will go well!
  
- **[27. Sep. 2024]** I am excited to have a one-week internship at [State Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Grid_Corporation_of_China) (Changping, Beijing), under the guidance of [Dr. Xi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=r6BeldgAAAAJ), learning the concepts of virtual power plants and games in the power market.
  
- **[10. Aug. 2024]** My [master thesis](https://github.com/pwang30/master_thesis.git) has been translated to English using Overleaf, which is a good practice for me to get familiar with this tool. Also a file to remind me to love **LEE**.

## Codes Sharing

- **[21. Jan. 2025]** A comprehensive note for calculating short circuit current based on IEEE-39 bus system, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults. Here is the [link](https://github.com/pwang30/Short_Circuit_Analysis_IEEE39.git) for the source code in Matlab. The Julia version will be available soon.
  
- **[13. Jan. 2025]** The code for solving a Stackelberg game via a bilevel model is on sharing. We consider DSO maximizing profits in the upper level, while VPPs minimizing operating costs in the lower level. Here is the [link](https://github.com/pwang30/Code_of_bilevel_DSO_VPPs.git) for the source code in Julia. Here is the [corresponding paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07715), which is currently under review.

- **[05. Nov. 2024]** A simple note for unit commitment constrained DC-OPF power system problem is on sharing. Here is the [link](https://github.com/pwang30/OPF_in_DC_system_with_UC.git) for the guidance and source code in Julia.
