## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Power System at [Technical University of Madrid (UPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Madrid), supervised by [Prof. Luis Badesa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8DQgsZQAAAAJ). My current research line is "Power system economics with stability guarantees and resilience enhancement". Before this, I received my bachelor and master degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%87%8D%E5%BA%86%E9%82%AE%E7%94%B5%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6), supervised by [Prof. Yiwei Ma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yiwei-Ma-6).

## Research Interests

- **Power system optimization:** power market, optimal operation, stability guarantee
- **Clustering algorithm:** c-means, fuzzy c-means, improved clustering algorithms

## News

- **[Jan. 2025]** I have an internship in [清华四川能源互联网研究院(Tsinghua-Eiri)](https://www.tsinghua-eiri.org/), focusing on the power system.
- **[Oct. 2024]** I am thrilled to start research about power system as a Ph.D. student in UPM. Hope all will go well!
- **[Sep. 2024]** I am excited to have a one-week internship at [State Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Grid_Corporation_of_China) (Changping, Beijing), under the guidance of [Dr. Xi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=r6BeldgAAAAJ), learning the concepts of virtual power plants and games in the power market.
- **[Aug. 2024]** My [master thesis](https://github.com/pwang30/master_thesis/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) has been translated to English using Overleaf, which is a good practice for me to get familiar with this tool. Also a file to remind me to love **LEE**.
