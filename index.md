## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Power System at [Technical University of Madrid (UPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Madrid), supervised by [Prof. Luis Badesa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8DQgsZQAAAAJ). My current research line is "Power system economics with stability guarantees and resilience enhancement". Before this, I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%87%8D%E5%BA%86%E9%82%AE%E7%94%B5%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6), supervised by [Prof. Yiwei Ma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yiwei-Ma-6).

## Research Interests

- **Power system optimization:** Power market, System stability
- **Clustering algorithm:** Fuzzy c-means, Improved clustering methods

## News

- **[06. Oct. 2025]** Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05293) titled "Pricing Short-Circuit Current via a Primal-Dual Formulation for Preserving Integrality Constraints" is now available in arXiv. It is a work for pricing Short-Circuit Current (SCC) services with a new method, and we also analyze the pitfalls of existing pricing methods. Thanks, again, for the time and patience of my supervisor Luis, who contributed a lot to this work! The resources associated can be found below.
  
- **[29. Aug. 2025]** My [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20493) titled "Analyzing the Impact of Strategic Bidding on the Reserve Capacity via a Bi-Level Model" for 2026 1st IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES) International Meeting (IM) has been accepted.

- **[14. Aug. 2025]** Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09425) titled "Imperfect Competition in Markets for Short-Circuit Current Services" is now available in arXiv, the first work for checking the market power in Short-Circuit Current (SCC) services. Thanks for the time and patience of my supervisor Luis, who contributed a lot to this work! The resources associated can be found below.

- **[01. Apr. 2025]** Our paper titled "Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model" for 16th IEEE PowerTech Conference in Kiel has been accepted.
  
- **[10. Feb. 2025]** Welcome You Wu to our lab, studying as an exchange student from [North China Electric Power University](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%8E%E5%8C%97%E7%94%B5%E5%8A%9B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6). Her research topic is "Bilevel model application in the power market problems: Specifically for Stackelberg games". Hope we can have some interesting productions. (Supervision: 10. Feb. 2025-30. Jun. 2025)
  
- **[03. Jan. 2025]** I have an internship in [Tsinghua Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute](https://www.tsinghua-eiri.org/), focusing on the power system.
  
- **[01. Oct. 2024]** I am thrilled to start research about power system as a Ph.D. student in UPM. Hope all will go well!
  
- **[27. Sep. 2024]** I am excited to have a one-week internship at [State Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Grid_Corporation_of_China) (Changping, Beijing), under the guidance of [Dr. Xi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=r6BeldgAAAAJ), learning the concepts of virtual power plants and games in the power market.
  
- **[10. Aug. 2024]** My [master thesis](https://github.com/pwang30/master_thesis.git) has been translated to English using Overleaf, which is a good practice for me to get familiar with this tool. Also a file to remind me to love **LEE**.
